# Vessel Traffic Management System (SQL Project)

 # Introduction
This project is the backend database design for a Port Vessel Traffic Management System, implemented using SQL Server.  
It simulates vessel operations at ports, covering vessels, berths, and port calls.  
The database provides the server-side logic and data management required for analyzing port activities, vessel scheduling, and berth utilization.


# Features
- Vessel Management: Store details such as vessel name, IMO number, tonnage, and type.  
- Berth Allocation: Assign vessels to berths with availability checks.  
- Port Calls Tracking Maintain records of vessel arrivals, anchorage, berthing, and departures.  
- Cargo Handling: Track cargo type, tonnage, and loading/unloading operations.  
- Operational Analytics: Generate reports for berth utilization, vessel turnaround time, and cargo volumes.  


# Technologies Used 
- SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio): Tool for database creation, query execution, and management.  
- GitHub: Version control and project documentation.
